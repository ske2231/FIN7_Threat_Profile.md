# FIN7 Threat Profile – OSINT Research

This repository contains an open‑source intelligence (OSINT) research profile of the cybercriminal group **FIN7** (also known as Carbanak/Navigator Group).  
The goal is to provide a **structured, annotated, and recap‑safe dossier** of FIN7’s tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), mapped to the MITRE ATT&CK framework.

## 📌 Contents

  - Actor overview and campaign timeline
  - ATT&CK mappings
  - Indicators of Compromise (IOCs)
  - Tooling and malware associations
  - Defensive playbook
  - Detection snippets (Sigma rules, PowerShell queries)

## 🎯 Purpose
This project is designed for:
- Security researchers tracking FIN7’s evolving tradecraft  
- Blue teams building detections and defenses  
- Educators and analysts studying adversary TTPs  

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This repository is for **educational and defensive purposes only**.  
It does not contain live malware or operational infrastructure.  
All IOCs and detection rules should be validated and adapted to your environment before use.
